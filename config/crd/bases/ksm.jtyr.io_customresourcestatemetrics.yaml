                  This operator doesn't analyze nor modifies its content. It just
                  writes its content into a ConfigMap as is. This is mainly because the kube-state-metrics package
                  lacks the "omitempty" JSON tag flag as well as the "DeepCopy*"
                  methods for the individual types.
